# dfs_traversal_game
A interactive game created using the concept of depth first search traversal algorithm


Depth first search (DFS) is a graph traversal technique that allows visiting all the nodes of a graph in depth first manner. The traversal is modified where there will be two persons who want to traverse the graph in DFS, both of them start from the same location and no two persons can occupy the same node in the graph. Each person will get the chance one by one. The one who first complete the traversal of the graph, considering the restriction that there will be no cycle during the visit of the nodes, wins the game. Simulate the two person DFS traversal using Java program.

Assumptions: Graph G is connected, undirected and weighted
